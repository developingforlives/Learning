      <h1>Images</h1>
      Embed this mochi.jpg image in our images.html page with the following snippet (this also includes a bit of navigation to our other pages):

      <h2>JPGs</h2>

      <p>JPG images are good for photos.</p>
      <p>JPG images are designed for handling large color palettes without exorbitantly increasing file size. This makes them great for photos and images with lots of gradients in them. On the other hand, JPGs don’t allow for transparent pixels, which you can see in the white edges of the image below if you look real close:</p>

      <img src="images/mochi.jpg" width="75" alt="A mochi ball in a bubble"/>

      <h2>GIFs</h2>

      <p>GIFs are good for animations.</p>
      <p>GIFs are the go-to option for simple animations, but the trade off is that they’re somewhat limited in terms of color palette—never use them for photos. Transparent pixels are a binary option for GIFs, meaning you can’t have semi-opaque pixels. This can make it difficult to get high levels of detail on a transparent background. For this reason, it’s usually better to use PNG images if you don’t need animation.</p>

      <h2>PNGs</h2>

      <p>PNGs are good for diagrams and icons.</p>
      <p>PNGs are great for anything that’s not a photo or animated. For photos, a PNG file of the same quality (as perceived the human eye) would generally be bigger than an equivalent JPG file. However, they do deal with opacity just fine, and they don’t have color palette limitations. This makes them an excellent fit for icons, technical diagrams, logos, etc.</p>

      <h2>SVGs</h2>

      <p>SVGs are <em>amazing</em>. Use them wherever you can.</p>
      <p>Unlike the pixel-based image formats above, SVG is a vector-based graphics format, meaning it can scale up or down to any dimension without loss of quality. This property makes SVG images a wonderful tool for responsive design. They’re good for pretty much all the same use cases as PNGs, and you should use them whenever you can.</p>

      <p>These 300×300 pixel images were originally 100×100 pixels, but scaling them up clearly shows the difference between them. Notice the crisp, clean lines on the left SVG image, while the PNG image on the right is now very pixelated.

      <p>Despite being a vector format, SVGs can be used exactly like their raster counterparts. Go ahead and add the mochi.svg to our images.html page:</p>
 
      <p>There is one potential issue with SVGs: for them to display consistently across browsers, you need to convert any text fields to outlines using your image editor (e.g., Abode Illustrator or Sketch). If your images contain a lot of text (like the fancy screenshots in this tutorial), this can have a big impact on file size. For this reason, <strong>InternetingIsHard.com uses PNGs instead of SVGs</strong>, even though SVGs are so awesome.</p>

<!--text alternatives:
Adding alt attributes to your <img/> elements is a best practice. It defines a “text alternative” to the image being displayed. This has an impact on both search engines and users with text-only browsers (e.g., people that use text-to-speech software due to a vision impairment).
Update all our images to include descriptive alt attributes:-->
