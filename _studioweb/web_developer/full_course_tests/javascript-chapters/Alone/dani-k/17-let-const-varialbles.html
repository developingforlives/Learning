   var a = "Global Scope";

   function example() {
      var b = "Local Scope";
   }

   console.log(a); //this variable can be accessed of any part of the code, but demands more memory allocated.

   //console.log(b); //you got a error message because this variable in fact is insido of a Function (this is an example of Local Scope).

   if (1 == 1) {
      var a = 10;
   }

   console.log(a);

   //***VERY IMPORTANT*** A variable inside of a Function Scope, cannot be accessed externally, BUT a variable inside of Block Scope (if, while, for), can be accessed accessed externally.

   //THEREFORE... let and const came to fix this flow fault with var variable.

   //let

   if (1 == 1) {
      let b = 10;
   }

   //console.log(b);//now you got an error even this variable being inside of the Block Scope, using let, tixed the issue about var variable.

   //const - Variables defined with const behave like let variables, except they cannot be reassigned:

   const EXAMPLE = 20;
   console.log(EXAMPLE);
   //EXAMPLE = 15; if try to change the value a const variable, you will get am error message.
